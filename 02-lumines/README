For this game we have given you a framework and you will need to implement the
actual logic to make the game run.

We've given you the event-loop that drives the game and handles keyboard input, a graphic 
module that deals with rendering the game onto the screen, and the logic for dealing with the 
sweeper for the game.

You will have to implement the logic that keeps the game state correct and updates
things based on those inputs!

The functions for you to implement are in 
board.ml
game.ml
moving_piece.ml

To compile the tests, run:
dune runtest

To run the game, run: 
dune exec bin/lumines.exe

A suggested ordering for working through this (though feel free to do in a different order if you prefer) is:

  moving_piece.ml rotate_left
  moving_piece.ml rotate_right
  (Note that you can test these by running the game and rotating the piece even if you don't yet 
  have a way to move the piece on the board)

  board.ml add_piece
  game.ml tick
  (Once you have these two you'll be able to have pieces fall down onto the board)

  game.ml can_move
  game.ml move_left
  game.ml move_right
  game.ml drop

  board.ml mark_squares_that_are_sweepable
  board.ml remove_squares

Once this is working, there are many extensions that we'd love to see you try
to implement. For example:
- calculate a score
- make the game speed up over time
- change the color scheme after a certain number of blocks have been cleared
- add blocks that have different abilities (e.g. one that clears adjacent blocks)

  We're sure you can come up with some interesting extensions of your own too.
